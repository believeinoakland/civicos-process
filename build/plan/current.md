# Plan: the process built under itself · N2

**Status** · OPEN · opened 30 Oct 2026 on Bob's word; round R1, epoch E1; the process pinned at `a0f8c6f` (the `tranche` tip when layer 1's two jobs were started, 20:30Z; MNT-3). Written from REQUIREMENTS.md (accepted) and from what remains (P19). One round, five layers, lowest first; all jobs of a layer start together unless the architecture session starts a subset first (PLN-8). Every job's first act is to read its module's requirements file whole (REQ-6); every job extracts its module from `proc-legacy` (`tools/proc.mjs`, `tools/lib.mjs`, `tools/hooks.mjs`), writes one test per requirement id it meets, and leaves proc-legacy delegating to it (REQ 9: the net change in the legacy files is a removal).

**The legacy census** (PLN 8). `proc-legacy`: 2,604 + 463 + 450 lines. Retired by the jobs below in this tranche, down to the command dispatcher (`COMMANDS`, `args`), which the last job (shims) leaves as the one entry point `tools/proc.mjs`. Hard reasons for anything left: none known.

**What runs this tranche** (MNT-2, the bootstrap). The last proven version of the process is today's `main` with the hooks removed (nothing holds the certification mark). Its tool is the helper: `layer start` opens each job's branch and draft pull request; the gate in CI is today's suite plus the checks until the gate job lands, after which the shims job writes this repository's own `gate.yml`. The architecture session of the process is the lane's successor, started by Bob (MNT-9). No hook is wired, no session archives another, no scheduled task is required (PLT-2, PLT-4, PLT-7).

**Version pin** (MNT-3). This tranche runs on the process commit named in the plan's Status line at its open; the pin moves only at a stop (MNT-4). Civicsmith is halted and picks up the result at its own resume, as a subset of its next layer first (PLN-8).

**Measurements** (SES-12, taken by the architecture session, never by a job): per layer, commits by purpose, sessions per job, gate runs per merged job, restarts, tokens by role; the reading set of every job at its start (REQ-6).

## Layer 1 · foundations

**platform**
- N2-1 · PLT-1, PLT-3, PLT-12: `tools/platform.mjs` holds the constraints table as data (`tools/platform.md` is its rendering): each row a measured fact, date, count, evidence, workaround; the acts the process depends on with their pass counts (today's: `create_session` 23+, `send_message`, pull request calls, `actions_run_trigger`, own-branch push). The act table `tools/acts.md` is folded into it and retired as a prediction table. Test: every platform call any module prints is a row; a row without a date fails the format check.
- N2-2 · PLT-9, PLT-10: the runner workflows' dispatch (repo setup, rename, transfer, shims) and `grants check` move here from proc-legacy unchanged in behaviour, with their tests.
- N2-3 · PLT-13, PLT-14: no function here takes the process repository as a write target for a product role; the onboarding route (public, read grant, or carried) is a value the record holds.
- N2-4 · MNT-3's check: `processHead`, `versionCheck` move here: one check at a session's start against the pin, printing PROCESS OK or STALE; nothing calls it per command.

**record**
- N2-5 · REC-1, REC-2, REC-3: `tools/record.mjs` takes `repo`, `stateRead/List/Write`, `epochOpen/Close`, `commitPush`, `unpushed`, `parsePlan`, `planEdit`, `metricsRow` and `status`'s reading of the state; the path tables (durable, transient) are data with a test that no path is in both.
- N2-6 · REC-5: a remote act is recorded by the command that takes its result, never by a request; the refresh record of proc-legacy (`REFRESH_FILE`) and every pre-hook write are removed.
- N2-7 · REC-6: `addr` reads an address from `main` or the tranche at the moment of use; a test that an address on a side branch is not read.
- N2-8 · REC-7: `status` on a fresh clone of a halted build prints everything open, idle, merged, unmerged, owed; fixture: Civicsmith's halt of 30 Oct as a frozen fixture (its state branch and handoff copied).
- N2-9 · PLN-5's record: the Status line's `STOPPED <why> · <version>` and `RESUMED <version>` forms, read by every role's `status`.

## Layer 2 · the shape of a product

**architecture**
- N2-10 · ARC-3: the words check refuses a literal user-facing sentence in a test and names the key; the coverage and fixtures checks unchanged. Test: a fixture test with a sentence fails, the same test by key passes.
- N2-11 · ARC-5, GAT-7: `checks/run.mjs` writes one machine-readable result (module, file, line, check, finding) beside its text; `status` and the gate read it.
- N2-12 · ARC-4: scoping to a module and the whole-product run are one function with a `--module` switch; the layer-close run is the whole-product run.

**requirements**
- N2-13 · REQ-1, REQ-4: parsing of requirement files, `serviceBlocks`, the mark strike move to `tools/requirements.mjs` with their tests.
- N2-14 · REQ-3: the format check refuses a Test line naming a fixture above the size the product sets in its manifest (default 100,000 rows); the review brief says a measurement not taken is not a gap.
- N2-15 · REQ-6, SES-5, SES-6: `readingSet` measures a job's set against a budget that is a fraction of the model's window from the Sessions table, never a byte literal; a set over budget is recorded (size, module, what was trimmed or split) and the job is not started; the summary path for a module's own requirements is removed (SES-7).

## Layer 3 · the work

**planning**
- N2-16 · PLN-2, PLN-4, PLN-5, PLN-8: `tools/planning.mjs` takes tranche open/carry/close, round open/close, footprint, ruling; adds `stop --why` (marks each unmerged job of the layer complete-allowed or abandoned by the architecture session's choice, records the pin), `resume --version <commit>` (moves the pin once), and `layer start --modules` recorded with its reason as a partial layer.
- N2-17 · PLN-6, SES-12: the tranche report's fields, the overhead counts computed from git (commits by purpose, sessions per job, gate runs per merged job, restarts) and from the metrics.
- N2-18 · PLN-7: no function here reads or writes a path outside the product's own repository; a test with two product fixtures on one checkout.

**jobs**
- N2-19 · JOB-1 to JOB-3, JOB-6 to JOB-8: `tools/jobs.mjs` takes layer start, job pr/started/route/start/state/complete/takein/posted/reopen/retire/archived, defect; the START generator names only tool commands (a test enumerates its acts against `COMMANDS`).
- N2-20 · JOB-4: `job route` replaces a dead session with a brief from the branch and pull request, not a re-read of the module; no function archives or replaces a live job for a version; the abandon and complete-allowed choices are read from the plan's stop record.
- N2-21 · JOB-5: `job complete` runs locally only ownership, format and the module's own suite when it is under a minute (measured by the previous run's record), pushes, posts, marks ready, sets COMPLETE; the in-session gate is removed.
- N2-22 · JOB-9, JOB-10: the Stop-hook rules become the record: `status` lists a job WORKING with nothing pushed for an hour; each job attempt's reading set and tokens are its own row.

**gate**
- N2-23 · GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-6: `tools/gate.mjs` holds `runGate` for CI only: the module's own suite and the checks scoped to it; `usersOfChange` and every user-suite path removed; the workflow template `tools/gate.yml.tmpl` triggers on the module's paths and tests, the files the checks read for it and generated inputs, never on record paths.
- N2-24 · GAT-4: artifacts regenerated, verified only when changed against HEAD.
- N2-25 · GAT-5: every lock installed where it sits; Node from the product's version file (as today, proven live).
- N2-26 · GAT-8: the full regression as its own workflow, dispatched only by `tranche close` for a release or on Bob's word.

**integration**
- N2-27 · INT-2, INT-3, INT-6: `tools/integration.mjs` takes review decide/result, merge, `gateNeutral`, merged, job retire's record half, bob release; nothing in a merge or close calls `archive_session`; retirement is a record line and the usage read by SES-10's route or named unmeasured.
- N2-28 · INT-4 and P11: `layer close` runs the layer's tests (from the manifest) over the merged layer and refuses to close on a red, naming the module and printing the CHANGE for its job.
- N2-29 · INT-5: the completion round, tranche close, close pull request, release cut, deployment and walk kept as today, each with a fixture test, and the tranche report naming any stage that runs for the first time under a version.

## Layer 4 · the people

**sessions**
- N2-30 · SES-1, SES-2, SES-3: `tools/sessions.mjs` takes takeover, handoff (at most one screen, generated), root start/bob, lane open/started/start/state/charter/route/close/archived, bobArchived, the models table; `status` prints the context share from `get_session` and REFRESH when past the role's threshold; no successor is started by its predecessor (the lane's self-spawn `processHandoff` → a handoff file for Bob's or the starter's `create_session`).
- N2-31 · SES-4, SES-5: each role's reading set with sizes at start; budgets as fractions of the window in one table.
- N2-32 · SES-9, REC-8: `audit reads --layer <n>` reads a sample of the layer's job transcripts (`list_events`) for one whole read of the requirements file before the first write, and files a flaw report on a miss.
- N2-33 · SES-10, SES-13: usage by a route PLT-3 allows (measured first: `list_events` usage fields, or `get_session`), else unmeasured; nothing counts on a parent being alive.
- N2-34 · the process's own architecture session (MNT-9): `process start`, `process handoff`, `process archived` reduced to: record the role, print the handoff, write the START file for Bob's `create_session`; the owed archive, backstop and address-announce acts removed.

**messages**
- N2-35 · MSG-1, MSG-2, MSG-7: `tools/messages.mjs` takes `addr` and the ask commands; a message whose delivery fails is recorded undelivered and listed by `status`.
- N2-36 · MSG-3, MSG-5: no Stop hook, no judge: `hooks.mjs stop|evidence|display` deleted; `say` stays as a voluntary deterministic plain-words check (`plainReason`) a session may run on its own draft, with no model call; `turnEvidence` and the judge prompt deleted.
- N2-37 · MSG-4, MSG-6: `steps` (verified from the page) stays; the flaw-report route is unchanged and tested with a product whose account holds no role here (PLT-13).

## Layer 5 · the process itself

**maintenance**
- N2-38 · MNT-3, MNT-4, MNT-6, MNT-8: `tools/maintenance.mjs` takes issue file/ack/close/reply/seen, productReports, processReplies; `processRefresh` becomes `version newer` (an anonymous read of `main`'s tags against the pin, called by `layer close` to offer the stop) and `processBehind` becomes the one start-time check (N2-4); the hourly refresh and per-command checks removed.
- N2-39 · MNT-7, MNT-10: the version note (`VERSIONS.md`): per version, the layers and stages it has been proven by with their product sizes, and whether it holds the certification mark; `layer close` appends the layer's proof row; the mark is written only by `tranche merged` after a release's deployment and walk on a real product.
- N2-40 · MNT-1, MNT-2, MNT-5: the lane's record (`lane-neoprocess/`) becomes this product's build state: DRYRUN's rows migrate to the version note; fixes that do not block are placed in `next.md` for the next process tranche, never merged mid-layer.

**shims**
- N2-41 · SHM-1: `tools/shims.mjs` takes `shims`, `settingsText` (permissions only; no hooks, no env), the CLAUDE.md template naming the pinned commit and the one clone command, the gate workflow from the gate module's template, the prune workflow; `init`, `initCheck`, `onboardStart`.
- N2-42 · SHM-2: `repo shims` runnable from the product's own repository with its own secret (a second workflow template the product may hold), proven on the first other-owner product.
- N2-43 · SHM-3, SHM-4, SHM-5: onboarding measures the product against §0's sizes and reports each dimension beyond the proven range; `tranche carry` removes stale tracking refs first; the product's setup script is named in its manifest and run by its sessions' first command, not a hook.
- N2-44 · this repository's own shims: `gate.yml` for the process repository written by the module and merged, so the process is gated as a product from layer 5 on (ARC-1's import check then runs over `tools/`).

proc-legacy (no job: retired by the jobs above)
- At the layer's close `tools/proc.mjs` holds only `COMMANDS` and `args`, delegating to the modules; `tools/lib.mjs` and `tools/hooks.mjs` are deleted; the legacy row leaves `build/modules.json`.

---

## Deferred, with the hard reason (PLN 2)
- INT-5's stages proven live, and the certification mark: a real product's full tranche, deployment and walk (a measurement that cannot happen inside this tranche).
- PLT-14's private-product route and SHM-2's other-owner workflow proven live: something outside the product that does not yet exist (no such product).
- SES-9's confidence: measured on the first product layers run under this version (a measurement outside this tranche).
- P11's text in `PROCESS-DESIGN.md`: Bob's word to change the principle file (a decision of Bob's not yet made; the wording is accepted in REQUIREMENTS.md §14).
