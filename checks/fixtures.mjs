// Check 6, fixtures (bio rulings K4990, K4993 (2), K4995, K4996; plan F9 §7 item 7): measures that no module's test
// hand-builds another module's answer or a stub of another module's interface, and that no test names a refusal code
// that no product source gives. DRAFT (bio K4993 (2)): not run by checks/run.mjs; its text binds only when Bob approves it (K1258).
// Candidates are found mechanically over the whole tree, so the list, not a sample, is the audit's coverage (K4996).
// Files read: tracked JS/TS files under a module's `tests` paths and under test-support's `paths` (the harness), never
// node_modules, dist, vendored code or generated files. Source = tracked files under the `paths` of every module but
// test-support. Three classes, each failure reported as `<class> <user module> <file>:<line> [tag] <excerpt> -> <provider>`:
//   answer    an object literal of another module's answer shape (tag = the shape): `ok` with `reason`, `detail`, `refusal`,
//             `error` or `failure_class` (refusal, `ok` written as true or false); `ok` with `done`, `final`, `outstanding` or `waiting_on` (owed);
//             an `extent` whose value opens `{ kind` (extent; not where the literal is the argument of a member call, an input). A literal that is an argument of an assert/expect call is an
//             expected value, not a hand-built answer, and is skipped. A literal whose `reason` code only the user module's
//             own source gives is the user's own shape and is skipped. Tag `invented <CODE>` when its code is in no source.
//   stub      (1) an identifier named *Stub, *Fake, *Double, fake*, stub* or double* (camel-case word), once per file and name, at
//             its first declaration, import or use (tag `decl`, `import`, `use`); (2) a function standing in for a service
//             of INTERFACE_NAMES (registerJob, readHeld, armJobs, owedLater, keepLater, deliver, partsOf, ...) that the user
//             module's own source does not define: `x.name = ...`, `name: <function>`, `name(...) {` in an object, or a
//             declaration `function name` / `const name` in the test (tag `stand-in`). A call of the real service is no stand-in.
//   code      a string literal shaped like a refusal code (UPPER_SNAKE with an underscore) given as a `reason`, `code`, `error`,
//             `failure_class`, `refusal` or `why` (key, or the other operand of a comparison or assertion) in a test, found
//             in no source file at all. Not reported again where it sits inside a flagged `answer` literal (that carries tag `invented`).
// Tightening (second pass): an `extent` literal is an answer only inside a stub or double's body or value, or given as the argument of a call
// of one, never as data passed in; a refusal/owed literal that is a direct argument of a member call or of a helper imported from another
// module (a real provider or the harness) is an input, not an answer (a Response.json, resolve/reject or stub call still builds one); names in
// PLATFORM_DOUBLE (FakeDate, fakeBinding, alarmDouble, and fake/stub/double or *Stub/*Fake/*Double of Date, Clock, Timers, Fetch, R2, DO, KV, Bucket,
// Binding, Alarm, Storage, Miniflare, Workerd, ...) are never stubs; a bare local `stub`/`fake`/`double` counts only where its value or its
// `stub.name =` assignments name another module's exported name (6+ characters; tag `spy standing in <name>`); a code literal that the file both
// feeds in (outside an assertion) and asserts (inside one) is pass-through data: not class `code`, and not an `invented` tag.
// Third pass: a bare spy's exported name must be compound (not one lower-case word such as `settings`); an answer literal inside the arguments of a
// plug-in registrar call (`register*`, `on*`, but not a listed seam) is the user's own code; a literal that is a direct argument of a function the user
// module imports from its OWN product source is an input; a code under a data key (`why`, `data`, `meta`, `payload`, `extra`, `fields`, `input`,
// `args`, `params`) is data, and `why` is no longer a code key.
// Fourth pass: a refusal/owed literal nested in an object or list that is itself the argument of such an input call is an input; a `why`-keyed
// `ok` literal (no `reason`) and a `code` in an object pushed into a list (`findings.push({ code })`) are the module's own data; a stub or double name
// imported from the user's own product source is its own double and skipped.
// K5044 (the T51 fixture audit's rules). (1) Skipped as not another module's answer: a platform double (a named stub whose value has a `fetch`
// member, i.e. a Durable Object or store double, with its `{ok, result}` wrapper and trap branches; fakeCtx, installRuntime, loadWorker; stubSdk,
// stubClaude; a `{head, get, put}` bucket; a `{calls, binding}` double; an IndexedDB double by name; the literals inside any `fetch` stand-in);
// a fault injection (a stand-in whose body only throws, never settles `new Promise(() => {})`, returns undefined, or returns a nameless
// `{ok:false}`); a delegating wrapper or spy (its body calls the same-named function of another object); a pass-through (an answer literal whose
// code the same test also asserts, as for codes; a raw `{ok:false, error: e.stack|e.message}`; a lower_snake `reason`, a provider's vocabulary);
// the user's own seam (a literal handed through `.transact(`, the user's own export or a local wrapper of it, or under a `check`/`validate`
// key); harness-own values (test-support's own tests, its generators `*gen.mjs`/corpus/seeded/make-*, an object naming `test-shell`, stub names
// imported from the user's own tests); a name clash (a local `function deliver` never handed in as a value; `double_`/`fake_`/`stub_` snake_case
// keys); an expected value held in a variable used only inside assertions. A template `PREFIX_${..}` in source gives every code with that prefix.
// (2) `// fixtures-generic: <CODE>` on the candidate's line or up to MARK_SPAN lines above accepts a code made up on purpose (an invented code, a
// sentinel; class code too); a code it does not name stays a finding; a marker that covers no candidate fails (class contract, tag `idle-generic`).
// (3a) A local builder (a test function whose body builds a refusal or owed literal whose reason/code/error is a parameter) is reported at EACH
// call site, tag `builder <name>` (+ `invented <CODE>`), provider resolved from the code argument; its own literal is then not reported.
// (3b) A scripted op table: an object literal key that is a product op name, with a value (function or object) that builds an `{ok: ..}` answer,
// is one answer finding per entry, tag `op-table <op>`, provider the module declaring the op (the user's own op: skipped). Op names are read from
// product source (not test-support): the top-level keys of `DECLARED_OPS = Object.freeze({..})`, and of the object a function named `<x>Ops`
// returns at its own top level (`answersOps(..) { return { rule: .., .. } }`); a value that holds a further op table is judged at its entries.
// (4) A `fixtures-contract` marker in a test-support (harness) file covers the whole value (declaration) that follows it, and every import of
// that value in other modules' tests; the provider's tests must carry `// fixtures-run: test-support <id>`, as for any contract.
// V3 (K5044 read against the live list of the T51 tip: the audit's FALSE lines the check still listed). Fixes of K5044 (1): a stand-in written `async (..) =>` is
// read as a function (a fault when it only throws, counts or answers nothing, `() => ({})` included); the absence of a service (`x.owedLater = undefined`) and a
// list of faults (`for (const keepLater of [undefined, async () => { throw }])`) are faults; a spy that calls the product code the test imports (and builds no
// answer), or an alias of the original taken from the same object, a restore of the original and a name bound to a fault are no stand-in; a call through a
// namespace import (`U.run(..)`), a name bound by `await import(..)`, a loop name the table binds to the user's own exports, and the module under test as a
// test's own loader binds it (`export const M = await import(<own source>)`) are the user's own export; a test's own assertion helper (`(label, got, want)`)
// makes its `want` an expectation; an expected value is judged in the scope of its declaration; a code fed in as an object key and asserted back is a
// pass-through, and so is a row of a case table (`for (const [body, status] of [..])`) whose name is asserted back as an operand in the loop (not a message,
// not a comparison, not computed over) or handed to the user's own code, unless the table holds a code only later modules give (a contract table, K4995) or
// the row copies a whole answer (`check` or `translation`); the seams of (1) hold for a bare code (a transaction's callback, a `check` key, a code handed to
// the user's own export as data, a table row) but not a fetch stand-in's invented code; a stack written out (`Error: ..\n at ..`, or a name holding one) is
// a raw platform error; a code from a provider's own function (`staleBaseRefusal().reason`) or data (`Object.entries(CHECKS)`) is built by the provider; plain
// data held in a `const` and handed to the user's own export is an input; `ERR_*` is the platform's vocabulary; the script handed to a platform double's factory is
// the double's. Names: a SQL handle, a fake time quantity (`fakeMs`), a stub got from `ns.get(ns.idFromName(..))` or made by a platform factory are platform.
// Markers: `// fixtures-generic: WORD` (K5044 (2)) names any word, not only an UPPER_SNAKE code, and an answer whose code is built or held in a name, or empty,
// is covered by any marker in reach; a stand-in is covered by the codes in it; `// fixtures-own: <platform|input|harness|synthetic> <why>` accepts what it covers
// (any class, same reach) for a double the audit read and found to be no module's answer and no rule can say so (a failing marker: class contract, `idle-own`).
// Provider: for a code, the modules whose source holds it; for a stub name, the modules whose files declare it (an import
// resolves to the module owning the file; STAND_FOR maps jobRegistrarStub to registerJob); for a stand-in, the modules whose
// source defines the service. Shown as `-> <modules> (earlier|later|mixed)` against the user's position in build/modules.json
// (array order), or `-> ?` when none is found. `--list` also prints the modules the file imports.
// THE CONTRACT MARKER (bio K4995): a hand-built answer or stub is accepted, not reported, only where its provider is LATER in
// modules.json than its user and a test of that provider runs it. The user marks the hand-built value with a line comment on
// the line of the candidate or up to MARK_SPAN lines above it (the nearest marker above a candidate is the one that covers it):
//     // fixtures-contract: <provider-module> <contract-id>
// and a file under the provider's `tests` runs the contract against the provider's real code and says so with
//     // fixtures-run: <user-module> <contract-id>
// (<contract-id>: letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_`; one id names one contract, which may cover many candidates). A marker whose
// provider is not later fails (tag `contract-not-later`: use the provider's published fixture, K4990), as does one the provider
// does not run (`contract-no-run`), one naming an unknown module (`contract-unknown-provider`), one covering no candidate
// (class `contract`, tag `idle`), and a `fixtures-run` no user marks (class `contract`, tag `orphan-run`). Class `code` is never accepted.
// Usage: node checks/fixtures.mjs <product-root> [module ...] [--list]
//   --list prints every candidate (accepted ones too) as `<class> <user> <file>:<line> <status> <tag> <provider> imports:<modules> <excerpt>`
//   for the reading workers, then the summary, and exits 0.
