Brief review-record · for BOB #2 · 2026-10-30
Task: Review pull request #128 of module record (tranche N2) against the module's requirements. Report only correctness gaps against the requirements, each with the requirement id, file:line, and a way to show it (a command or a test). No style, no praise, no rewrite. Why this review: second completion after a review that found gaps (INT 4: new module; the gaps verified closed); concerns: diff of 1161 lines (over 400); provided service changed (52 export line(s) differ).
Read whole, and nothing else: build/requirements/record.md (the requirements); the diff, by `git -C /home/user/neoprocess diff origin/tranche...origin/job/record`; the job's report, by `git -C /home/user/neoprocess show origin/state/E1:jobs/record/report.md`.
Write your result to: /home/user/neoprocess/.git/proc-review-record.md
Form of the result: first line `VERDICT · approve` or `VERDICT · gaps`; then one line per gap: `- R<id> · <file>:<line> · <what fails> · <how to show it>`.
If you need something not listed above, stop and write what it is in the result; do not search for it.
End with the line: DONE review-record · verdict
Model: Opus · Effort: high · Due: 60
